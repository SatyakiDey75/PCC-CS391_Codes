# Linked List Operations

## Problem Description

Write a C program to perform the following operations on a linked list:

1. Creation: Create a linked list by adding elements one by one.
2. Insertion at the beginning position: Insert a new element at the beginning of the linked list.
3. Display: Display all elements in the linked list.
4. Exit: Exit the program.

## Linked List Operations

The program should implement the linked list data structure and allow the user to perform the following operations:

1. Creation: The user should create a linked list by adding elements one by one.
2. Insertion at the beginning position: The user should be able to insert a new element at the beginning of the linked list.
3. Display: The program should display all elements currently in the linked list.
4. Exit: The user can choose to exit the program.

## Input

The program takes the following input:

1. User input for the operation to be performed (a for creation, b for insertion, c for display, d for exit).
2. If the user chooses insertion, the element to be inserted at the beginning.

## Output

The program displays the following output:

- The linked list after performing the operations.

## Example

Suppose we have an empty linked list.

If the user performs the following operations:

`1 (Creation) -> Element to insert: 10`\
`1 (Creation) -> Element to insert: 20`\
`3 (Display)`\
`2 (Insertion), Element to insert: 5`\
`3 (Display)`\
`4 (Exit)`


The program will display the following output:

`Linked List: [20, 10]`\
`Linked List after insertion: [5, 20, 10]`


## Notes

- The solution should handle any valid user inputs and operations.
- The program should use a custom algorithm to implement the linked list and perform the operations.
