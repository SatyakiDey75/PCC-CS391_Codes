# Queue Implementation using Array

## Problem Description

Write a C program to implement a queue using an array. The queue should support four operations: insert, delete, display, and exit. The user should enter 1 to insert an element, 2 to delete an element, 3 to display the queue, and 4 to exit the program.

## Queue Operations

1. Insert an element into the queue.
2. Delete an element from the front of the queue.
3. Display the elements in the queue.
4. Exit the program.

## Input

The program takes the following input:

1. User input to perform the queue operations (1 to insert, 2 to delete, 3 to display, 4 to exit).

For insert operation:

2. The element to be inserted in the queue.

## Output

The program displays the following output:

- The queue after performing each operation (insert, delete, and display).

## Example

Suppose the user performs the following operations:

`1 (Insert) -> Element to insert: 10`\
`1 (Insert) -> Element to insert: 20`\
`3 (Display)`\
`2 (Delete)`\
`3 (Display)`\
`4 (Exit)`


The program will display the following output:

`Queue: [10, 20]`\
`Queue after deletion: [20]`

## Notes

- The solution should handle any valid user inputs and operations.
- The program should use a custom algorithm to implement the queue using an array.
