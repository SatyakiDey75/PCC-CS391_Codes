# Stack Implementation using Array

## Problem Description

Write a C program to implement a stack using an array. The stack should support the following operations:

1. Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
3. Display: Print the elements of the stack.
4. Exit: Terminate the program.

## Input

The program takes the following input:

1. The user's choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) to perform a specific operation.

## Output

The program displays the following output:

- The elements of the stack after each operation (push, pop, display).

## Example

Suppose the user performs the following operations:

`1 (Push) -> 10`\
`1 (Push) -> 20`\
`1 (Push) -> 30`\
`3 (Display)`\
`2 (Pop)`\
`3 (Display)`\
`4 (Exit)`

The program will display the following output:

`Stack: [10, 20, 30]`\
`Popped element: 30`\
`Stack: [10, 20]`

## Notes

- The stack can hold elements of any data type (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, or other data types).
- The solution should handle empty stack scenarios (e.g., popping or displaying when the stack is empty).
- The program should use a custom algorithm to implement the stack using an array.
