# Array Insertion and Deletion

## Problem Description

Write a C program to perform insertion and deletion operations on an array.

## Array Insertion

The program should implement an array with a fixed size and allow the user to perform the following operation:

1. Insert an element at a given position in the array.

## Array Deletion

The program should also allow the user to perform the following operation:

1. Delete an element from a given position in the array.

## Input

The program takes the following input:

1. An array with a fixed size.
2. The element to be inserted and the position where it should be inserted.
3. The position from which an element should be deleted.

## Output

The program displays the following output:

- The array after performing the insertion and deletion operations.

## Example

Suppose we have an initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`


If the user wants to insert the element 10 at position 2, and then delete the element at position 4, the program should display:

`Array after insertion: [1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\
`Array after deletion: [1, 10, 2, 4, 5]`


## Notes

- The solution should handle any valid array size and positions.
- The program should use a custom algorithm to perform the insertion and deletion operations.
